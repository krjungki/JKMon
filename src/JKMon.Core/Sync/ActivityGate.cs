/// The counter measures file I/O, not network transfer, so a client reading its own database or cache looks
/// identical to one reading a file in order to upload it. A 10 minute idle measurement of OneDrive sat under
/// 8 KiB/s for 198 of 200 samples and then produced a single two-sample burst peaking at 988 KiB/s, which no
/// threshold separates from a real transfer. Requiring the rate to stay up for several consecutive samples is
/// what rejects that burst, so the gate asks for sustained activity before it asserts and then holds the signal
/// across the short lulls between the bursts of a real transfer.
